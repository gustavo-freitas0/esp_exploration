1 - I couldn't use VS Code together with the Arduino IDE. I had to add the path of the
libraries in c_cpp_properties.json. In addition, some of them didn't work, so I also added
"USBCON" to the defines.

2 - All the .ino files must be in a folder with the same name. If you don't do this 
an error related to not finding the main file.
